//- We use the inline SCSS file to inject CSS into the heaer of each HTML
// This CSS must be as small as possible and we'll only load the CSS needed
// for the initial content to be rendered in the browser. For this purpose we
// are using a wrapper that spans full with and height, so all the other content
// that follows will be pushed down. In our scenario, we'll have the title and
// description present, with a background for the wrapper, the continue button

// of the CSS will be found in style.css and will be loaded at the end of the
// HTML for faster rendering, so it doesn't block other content from being loaded.
// At the momemt, the inline.css is about 3kb and the style.css is about 9Kb.
// As the app/website grow in complexity only the size of the style.css should grow
// bigger. The 3Kb will be loaded an each page request, as it;s inline with the
// HTML code, and those 9Kb or more will be csched upon first visit and will
// be quickly loaded starting with second page and forward
